#------------ HOW WILL YOU REVERSE A LIST? --------

"""
-->Reversing a list using the reversed() and reverse() built-in function. 
- Using reversed() we can reverse the list and a list_reverseiterator object is 
  created, from which we can create a list using list() type casting.
  Or, we can also use list.
- reverse() function to reverse list in-place.

  - The list is better for performing operations,             |         - Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements.

  - Lists consume more memory.                                |         - Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list.
  - Lists have several built-in methods.                      |         - Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
